Recently I have been doing some brainstorming on ideas for my mini sumobot for this years rumble. Throughout the last two competitions I have come to appreciate the robustness of a simple no-nonsense design and accordingly don't have any major design changes planned. Instead I am looking at simplifying some of the more "complex" components currently being used and trying to focus on a clever programming routine instead.

So far, this has involved me dropping the twin [ultrasonic sensors][1] and instead will be using a simple pairing of ir leds and ir receivers, similar to that of Parallax SumoBots (see below).
