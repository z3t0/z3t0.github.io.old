Here I will be documenting new ideas for projects as I my brain lights up in different colors! Once an idea is more flushed out it will likely have its own post with more details. Ideas are sorted by pseudo-categories.


### Node.js / Javascript
- [ ] NodeJs multiplayer game server with front end client

### Bots
- [ ] reddit bot for r/ibo to direct lazy redditors to common resources!

### Study tools
- [ ] Quizlet desktop client
- [ ] Markdown to flash card generator (will probably end up written in JS)

### Robotics
- [x] Mesh network
- [x] simple path finding robot for BRRIT
- [ ] Arduino-IRremote 3.0 rewrite; [in progress](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/tree/dev)


### Mac
- [ ] write a bunch of alternative applications that have non existent memory footprints to replace exising mac products eg Serial emulator
- [ ] better package manager, brew is very slow

### Git tools
- [ ] write a better devscout ... its filled with bugs and im pretty sure its built on electron so!

### Other
- [ ] Write up a philosophical document, refer to suckless but you know maybe make the philosophy suckless than suckless' ... see what I did there?
