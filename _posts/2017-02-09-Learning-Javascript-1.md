title:  Learning Javascript Lesson 1
tags: [coding club]

Today we will be learning some basic features of the programming language Javascript. So far we've been independently working away with CodeAcademy, so treat today's lesson as a summary to make sure you understand some important concepts.

To begin create an account at [JSFiddle](jsfiddle.net) and then copy the following code into a new JSFiddle project. **If** you want an extra challenge than feel free to type out the code instead of copying it, practice makes perfect after all.

```js

// Variables
  // var SOMETHING = SOMETHING
var name = "Rafi Khan"

// Numbers
var aNumber = 12

// Booleans
var likeSchool = false

// Strings
var school = "Bedford Road Collegiate"

// Getting feedback
// console.log(TEXT)
console.log("Hi! I am learning to program")

// Control Statements

/* if (TEST) { 
	PUT WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN IF TEST IS TRUE
}
*/

if (likeSchool) {

  console.log("I like School")

}

// Functions
var print = function(input) {
	// input here is whatever variable you give to the function
  console.log(input)
}

```

Once you are done your screen should look something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/fwuFdlY.png). While you are waiting feel free to research the terms *strings, variables, booleans, numbers, javascript, functions* on Google to get a head start. Don't worry if you don't recognize any of these things because we will be going over them today!
